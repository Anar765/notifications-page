## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

### What I learned

About how to set up Sass in VS Code (*including downloading the Live Sass Compiler*) and some useful features of Sass.

### Continued development

Improve the structure of my code to make it more readable, understandable.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/default.php) - Very useful for learning basics of Sass quickly. *For this project I read about Sass Tutorial not Sass Functions.*
